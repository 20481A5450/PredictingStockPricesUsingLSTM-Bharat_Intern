## Introduction

This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock prices. It aims to provide insights into stock market trends and improve decision-making for investors.

## Project Overview

- Preprocess historical stock price data.
- Train an LSTM-based deep learning model.
- Evaluate the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Visualize and analyze the predicted vs. actual stock prices.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction
```

2. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

- Preprocess your stock price data and save it in a CSV file.
- Replace the `"netflix.csv"` file with your dataset.
- Modify hyperparameters and model architecture as needed.
- Run the Jupyter Notebook (`stock_prediction.ipynb`) for step-by-step execution.

## Data

- The project uses historical stock price data.
- You can find sample data in the `data/` directory.
- Ensure your dataset includes date and closing price columns.

## Model

- The LSTM-based model is defined in the `Model` class.
- Modify the model architecture and hyperparameters in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Training

- Train the model on historical stock price data.
- Adjust the number of training epochs and batch size as needed.

## Testing

- Use the `test_model_with_input` function to test the model with sample input data.
- Replace `sample_input` with your own data for testing.

## Results

- Visualize the model's predictions compared to actual stock prices.
- Analyze the results to gain insights into stock price trends.
